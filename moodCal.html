            <p>Being angry is not necessarily always bad, some the best things were invented by angry people. Lamborghini didn't produce a single car until Enzo Ferrari made him angry.
            <br /> At the same time, take a break, relax and chill out. Put all that fire into something productive</p>

            <h2>a stressful week for you</h2>
            <h2>Well,</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Many people who are stressed avoid people, places or situations that they associate with stress. Avoiding problems rather than facing them can make things worse.Stress may build up due to factors that are out with your control. 
            <br /> On the other hand, you might have developed a habit of taking on too much work. You may not feel confident saying 'no' when you are asked to take on new projects. There may be things that we can do to manage situations and prevent the stress from getting worse. Take stock of what is demanded of you. Try to realistically assess your ability to cope with these things. It may be possible to rebalance your commitments. Taking practical steps like this can help to resolve at least some of the stress that you experience.</p>

            <h2>many</h2>
            <h2>Emotions</h2>
            <br />
            <p>This week has really been a rollercoaster ride for you. Happy one day, then angry, then sad, then angry again. Oh no now your stressed ! BREATH, Just breath. It’s obvious you are very busy or your just super emotional (the best people always are). It’s time to take a step back, when dealing with a lot it’s easy to become too focused on everything but yourself and your health. Remember too take some time out, hit the reset button and give yourself some TLC (Tender Lovin’ Care).
